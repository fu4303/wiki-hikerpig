### 慕尼黑计程车实验

> Let’s take a look at yet another research - the classical Munich Taxi-cab Experiment conducted in the early 1980s. Although the research is not related to IT but road safety, the researchers encountered similar unintuitive results. In the 1980s German car manufacturers began to install the first ABS (anti-lock braking system) in cars. As ABS makes the car more stable during braking, it is a natural expectation that it improves safety on the road. The researchers wanted to find out how much. They cooperated with a taxi company that planned to install ABS in part of their fleet. 3000 taxi cars were selected and in half of randomly selected cars ABS was installed. The researchers had been observing the cars for 3 years. Afterward, they compared accident rates in the group with ABS and without ABS. The result was at least surprising, there was practically no difference, even the cars with the ABS were slightly more likely to be involved in an accident.
> As in the case of the research on bugs rate and concurrency bugs in Go, in theory, there should be a difference, but data shows otherwise. In the ABS experiment, the investigators had collected additional data. Firstly, the cars were equipped in kind of black boxes collecting information like speed and acceleration. Secondly, observers were assigned to the drivers to take notes of their behavior on the road. The picture from the data was clear. With ABS installed in the cars the drivers changed their behavior on the road. Noticing that now they have better control of the car and stopping distance is shorter the drivers started to drive faster and more dangerously, taking sharper turns, tailgating.
